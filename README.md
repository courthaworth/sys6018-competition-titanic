# sys6018-competition-titanic

This repository contains my first homework assignment for SYS6018 at the University of Virginia. The homework entails creating a model to 
submit to kaggle for the Titanic competition. We are given a number of features for each passenger and asked to build a model that predicts the survival status of that passenger. I am choosing to use logistic regression and doing feature selection based on which variables seem useful to the model using R.
